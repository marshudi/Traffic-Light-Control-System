# Traffic-Light-Control-System
This project simulates a traffic light system with multiple routines controlled by altering the 'mode' signal. It follows the World Advanced Traffic Light Control System, envisioned as part of Oman Vision 2040, featuring dedicated lights for cars and pedestrians on each side of a crossroad.
